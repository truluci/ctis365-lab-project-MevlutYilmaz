# Tree Growth Analysis Using the Orange Dataset
![treeGrowthAgeVsCircumference](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e01f2839-e6a1-4ed3-9531-65a0522dd76f)
## Description:
This scatter plot shows how the circumference of each tree changes as the tree ages. Lines connect points to indicate growth trends for individual trees.

## Observations:
### General Growth Trend:
- All trees show a positive relationship between age and circumference. As the trees age, their circumference increases.
- The growth is non-linear; initially, the increase is slow, but it accelerates as the trees mature.
### Tree Comparisons:
- Tree 4 and Tree 2 grow significantly faster and achieve the highest circumferences (~200 mm) by the end of the observation period.
- Trees 3 and 1 show the slowest growth, with circumferences plateauing around 120â€“140 mm.
- Tree 5 shows moderate growth, achieving a middle-range circumference.
### Age and Growth Milestones:
- Between 400 to 800 days, all trees show a steep growth phase.
- After 1000 days, growth for some trees slows down, particularly for Trees 1 and 3.

## Conclusion:
- There is a clear relationship between age and circumference, confirming that trees grow in circumference as they age.
- Trees 4 and 2 outperform others in growth rate and final circumference.
- The growth curves suggest that certain trees may have genetic or environmental advantages.

## Description:
This boxplot displays the distribution of circumference for each tree (Tree IDs: 1 to 5).

## Observations:
### Variability Across Trees:
- Tree 4 and Tree 2 have the largest circumferences overall, as seen by the higher medians and whisker ranges.
- Tree 3 and Tree 1 have lower median circumferences compared to the other trees.
### Spread of Data:
- Trees 4 and 2 show a wider range in circumference values, indicating faster and more significant growth variability.
- Tree 3 has a smaller range, suggesting relatively slow or consistent growth.
### Outliers:
There are no significant outliers in any tree's data, indicating uniform data distribution.

## Conclusion:
- Tree 4 and Tree 2 are the most robust in terms of circumference, while Trees 3 and 1 lag behind.
- The variability highlights that not all trees grow at the same rate.
